# Bizarro Memecoin Analysis

This project analyzes memecoin transaction data from [Solscan](https://pro-api.solscan.io/pro-api-docs/v1.0), aiming to identify patterns between the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), prices, and trading volumes. HHI is a commonly used measure of market concentration.

### Key Findings:
- **Price and HHI Correlation:** The analysis suggests a negative correlation between price and HHI. As a new memecoin launches, the market becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few holders, driving up the price.
- **Market Behavior:** Within the first few hours of a memecoin launch, market concentration increases, and prices surge. However, shortly after, large holders ("whales") often sell significant shares, causing a sudden price crash, after which the price typically remains at a low ("floor") level.
- **Further Research:** More data and analysis are required to fully prove the relationship between HHI and memecoin price movements.
